<h3 align="center">Now you can do it for <em>her</em></h3>

Do you seek self improvement? Is it still hard to do your tasks even though you can keep exact track of them?

Well, you're in luck! Introducing __Motivation Loop Habit Tracker__!

Now every single time you'll get notification about some habit you need to complete, there will be image of your waifu to motivate
you! Doesn't matter if you're weeb, ponyfag or anything else, now you can get reminded why are you doing it every time you do
it!

Of course you can also use any other image you like (even 3DPD if that's what you're into)

### Motivational Loop Habit Tracker additions over traditional Loop Habit Tracker

- Image of your selection on every notification you'll get
- (the same image) also in your number picker
- Image can be removed at any time in settings (in case you need to hide your powerlevel temporarily)

### Installation

!!Before installing this app either from source or from the releases page __MAKE SURE TO MAKE COMPLETE EXPORT OF YOUR DATA IN
SETTINGS!__!! as your data will be gone forever otherwise!

As for the actual instalation instructions. You can use the released prebuilt package
[here](https://github.com/qespr/MotivationalUhabits/releases/download/Motivational-v2.0.3/motivational-uhabits-android-debug.apk)
or build from source according to [original instructions](https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/blob/dev/docs/BUILD.md) nothing has
changed much because changes from this fork are really minimal.

### Some screenshots

If you wanna see how it looks like here are some screenshots. I included several images but please note that __only one image is
supported at a time__.

### Contributing

Motivational Loop Habit Tracker is pretty much complete at this point. But if you would still want to help with something, I can
always use more screenshots with different pictures.

Selecting one image per habit is _not planned_ and I haven't even checked how hard/easy would it be to do, so if you would like
that, you'll probably have to implement it yourself. However I'll gladly accept any PRs that would implement such or similar
functionality.

Otherwise if you want to contribute to the features other than the "image showing" you should (obviously) do so with the
[original project](https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits)
